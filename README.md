Feel free to use and add your own cards to each deck.
Simply open the code in a text editor and add more 'cards' to the list.
I am in no way affiliated with SuperFight and am creating this for my own purposes as practice. This is not for profit.
SuperFight has its own official digital version as DLC on TableTopSimulator.
